# DUAL-TONE-MULTIPLE-FREQUENCY-DECODER
This project is related to my Digital signal Processing course and project named as DTMF Decoder using MATLAB. In this project, I have 
designed a keypad in MATLAB using the GUI functionality of MATLAB. After designing the keypad, I have assigned a voice to each of these 
buttons. Obviously the voice attached to each button is different and when we press any of these buttons, then the MATLAB recognizes the 
respective button.
